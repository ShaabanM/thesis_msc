\chapter{Introduction}

The purpose of this report is to provide a general and pedagogical higher level understanding of SuperBIT. The report structure is as follows; I begin by providing an overview of the instrument and how it operates. I then present the the reader with the theoretical background necessary to understand the forecasted data analysis process as well as appreciate the challenges SuperBIT needs to overcome. Finally, I summaries some of my personal contributions to the instrument in some detail.
