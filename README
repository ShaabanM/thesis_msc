Shaaban's MSc Report Option 1

Description: 
The grade for the Research Course (based on the evaluation of the student's research performance) will be provided by the supervisor. The grade for the resulting report PHY 3400Y (maximum 20 pages) will be provided by an independent assessor who should be a faculty member of the Graduate Department of Physics. Both grades should be submitted by the end of the summer.

The implications for supervisors are :

 * You must ensure that the project that you have given your M.Sc. students can reasonably be completed by the middle of August at the latest so that their report can be in our hands
by the end of the THIRD week of August.

 *         You should appoint a report assessor for your students by June 15th. The assessor should be able to           grade the report as soon as it is received.

* You must be prepared to provide a Research Grade for your student at the end of summer. We will send you a reminder in August.

The implications for students are :

 * If you intend to apply for admission to our Ph.D. programme your M.Sc. report must be in the Graduate Office by the end of the THIRD week of August.

 *         You must submit to the Graduate Office by June 15th the name of your report assessor.
